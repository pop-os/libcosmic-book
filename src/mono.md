## Reducing Monomorphization

Rust uses monorphization to create multiple separate instances of types and functions that use genericsâ€”one for each type used.
Although it improves performance over dynamic dispatch, it will increase compile times and binary size significantly if used excessively.
If this is a concern, it will be important to keep elements across your application of the same message type.
One way that you can reduce this is to pass a closure into your view and update functions to allow the caller to perform the conversion in advance.

```rs
pub fn view<Out>(&self, on_message: impl Fn(Message) -> Out) -> cosmic::Element<Out> {
    // Where new tasks will be input before being added to the task list.
    let new_task_input = widget::text_input("Write down a new task here", &self.new_task_input)
        .on_input(on_message(Message::NewInput))
        .on_submit(on_message(Message::Add));

    // Fold each enumerated task into a widget that is pushed to a scrollable column.
    let saved_tasks = self.tasks.iter()
        .enumerate()
        .fold(widget::column(), |column, (id, task)| {
            column.push(
                // A hypothetical widget created for this app
                crate::widget::task(task.as_str())
                    .on_remove(on_message(Message::Remove(id)))
                    .on_input(|text| on_message(Message::EditInput(id, text)))
                    .on_move_down(on_message(Message::MoveDown(id)))
                    .on_move_up(on_message(Message::MoveUp(id)))
                    .into()
            )
        })
        .apply(widget::scrollable);

    // Compose the above widgets into the column view.
    widget::column::with_capacity(2)
        .spacing(cosmic::theme::active().cosmic().spacing.space_l)
        .push(new_task_input)
        .push(saved_tasks)
        .into()
}
```

However, since this function takes an `impl` type as an input paramter, it too will be monomorphized across different closure types used as the input.
In some cases you might want to use a [non-generic inner function](https://www.possiblerust.com/pattern/non-generic-inner-functions) where the inner function can be declared `#[inline(never)]`.
In others, it may be easier to use dynamic dispatch with trait objects via the dyn keyword.

```rs
pub fn view<Out>(&self, on_message: &dyn Fn(Message) -> Out) -> cosmic::Element<Out>
```

Or

```rs
pub fn view<Out>(&self, on_message: Box<dyn Fn(Message) -> Out>) -> cosmic::Element<Out>
```
