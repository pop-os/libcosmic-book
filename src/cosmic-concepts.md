# COSMIC Concepts

This section covers all aspects of libcosmic which are unique to the COSMIC toolkit.

All apps developed for COSMIC adhere to COSMIC's design language and interface guidelines.
This includes common interface elements such as the header bar, navigation bar, and context drawer.
Most of which are automatically derived for apps using the toolkit by default.

While it may be possible to ignore—and even override—them, apps developed for COSMIC should strive to utilize them in their designs.
Consistent application of interface concepts improves accessibility of applications in the COSMIC ecosystem.
